# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate
## Natural Language Processing Tensorflow
### by Coursera and  deeplearning.ai
This is my notes and assignment for the Coursera: [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow). I completed the [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice). The specialization program covers Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Relu, Dropout, and more. I built the models of image regconition, housing prices prediction, natural language processing, and more. The assignments are built in Python and in TensorFlow. I created this repositories for the people who are interested in deep learning.

Dependencies:

* Python 3 (or superior)
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Scikit Learn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* MatplotLib

The [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) is consisted of **FOUR** courses on deep learning, including artifical intelligence(ANN), convolutional neural networks(CNN), natural language processing (NLP), and Sequences.
